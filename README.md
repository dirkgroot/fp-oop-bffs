# FP and OOP: Best Friends Forever?

This repository contains sample code for my talk "FP and OOP: Best Friends Forever?". In this talk I perform a livecoded
refactoring, introducing FP techniques and patterns in OO/procedural Kotlin code.

## Starting point and end result

The end result of the refactoring is on the [`main`](https://github.com/dirkgroot/fp-oop-bffs/tree/main) branch. The
starting point of the refactoring can be obtained by checking out the
[`start`](https://github.com/dirkgroot/fp-oop-bffs/tree/start) tag:

```shell
git checkout start
```

## Refactoring steps

If you'd like to review all the individual steps in this refactoring, please refer to
the [commit history](https://github.com/dirkgroot/fp-oop-bffs/commits/main/) of this repository. A separate commit has
been made for every step in the refactoring.

## Slides

The slides for the talk are available [here](https://presentations.dirkgroot.nl/fp-oop-bffs).
